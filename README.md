# Pick and Place Robot

This project implements a Pick and Place Robot designed to automate the process of picking up objects from one location and placing them in another. The system utilizes a robotic arm equipped with a gripper, controlled by a combination of sensors, motors, and software algorithms to ensure precise movement and object manipulation.


## Features

- Robotic Arm: A versatile robotic arm with multiple degrees of freedom (DOF) that allows for a wide range of movement to pick and place items accurately.
- Gripper Mechanism: Equipped with a customizable gripper that can pick up and hold various objects securely.
- Sensor Integration: Utilizes vision sensors (e.g., cameras or LiDAR) to detect the position of objects and guide the robot’s movements.
- Path Planning: The robot uses motion planning algorithms (such as inverse kinematics) to determine optimal paths for reaching objects while avoiding obstacles.
- Control Software: Written in Python/C++ (or other relevant languages), the software controls the robot’s movements, processes sensor data, and ensures tasks are completed efficiently.

## Components
- Robotic Arm: Typically a 6-DOF robotic arm (custom-built).
- Gripper/End-Effector: Used to handle the objects.
- Controller: Usually a microcontroller (ESP32) for controlling the motors.
- Software: The control logic and algorithms running on a host computer or embedded system.
## Applications:
- Industrial Automation: For picking and placing parts in assembly lines.
- Warehouse Management: Automating the storage and retrieval of products.
- Lab Automation: Handling samples and test tubes in a laboratory setting.
- Home Automation: For personal assistants or smart home setups.
